# Flying Etiquette for J124 Quiz 4

For this assignment, I was given data about flying etiquette in which respondents could give their opinion (they were given options to choose from) on different questions about manners on flights.

Here is a link to the dataset used in this project: [Copy of Raw Data](https://github.com/keylajb/flying-etiquette-J124-quiz4/blob/main/Copy%20of%20Flying%20etiquette%2C%20quiz%204%20J124%20-%20Raw%20Data.csv)

## Etiquette Question of Choice

Of this data, the question I chose to visualize data on was 

**"Is it rude to wake a passenger up if you are trying to go to the bathroom?"**

## Why I Chose this Question

I chose this question because it is a personal, internal battle I deal with every time I fly on a plane. I worry excessively about appearing rude when having to get up to use the bathroom as someone who prefers the window seat on a flight. 

**I was curious to see if my opinion would be validated by this data or not.** 

Before visualizing this data my opinion was that it _**is**_ somewhat rude to wake someone up to go use the bathroom. I personally think that it is rude to wake someone up on short, 2 hour maximum long flights because passengers should be using the bathroom before the flight to eliminate having to get up during such a short flight. It would not be rude on long flights in my opinion since the body should not be holding their need to use the bathroom for long periods of time.

## What I found Interesting about this Dataset

I think that the amount of missing values there are for this question is interesting. There were a total of 1041 Respondants that answered _at least one_ of the questions in this survey but only 850 responded to this question in particular. I wonder by how much the data would change if **ALL** respondents had responded to this question. I had to eliminate the empty responses so my data is only about **80%** of the total number of people participating in this survey.

I also found it interesting how limited the options were or restricted the question was. I think the survey should have added a basis of flight time. For example, this survey question could have been: 

- **"Is it rude to wake a passenger up if you are trying to go to the bathroom on a flight that is less than 2 hours long?"** 

This could give different and perhaps more accurate results of the public's opinion. The alternative is giving more response options like:

- "Yes it is rude depending on _time of flight_"

- "Yes it is rude if you _chose_ a window seat" or 

- "No it is not rude if you were _placed_ in a window seat"

## What my Chart Shows and Reveals

The chart I made shows what about 80% _(850 question respondents)_ of the **survey total respondents** _(1041 people)_ think about waking up a passenger to go use the bathroom. 

535 Respondents think it is **not** rude at all to wake up a passenger to go use the bathroom. 

281 respondents think it is **somewhat** rude and 

34 think it is **very** rude to wake a passenger up to go use the bathroom.

Overall, about **60%** of these respondents view waking a passenger up to use the bathroom as not rude at all. 

## Limitations of Data

What this data fails to show us is why those 535 people believe it is not rude to wake up a passenger to go use the bathroom. It also fails to show what the demographic of these respondents is. 

- Are majority of these 535 respndents younger or older? 

- Are they mostly men or women? 

- Is this only economy class or is it buisness class travelers as well? 

There are many demographics that cannot be answered by this data alone.
