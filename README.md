# Flying Etiquette for J124 quiz 4

For this assignment, I was given data about flying etiquette in which respondents could give their opinion (they were given options to choose from) on different questions about manners on flights.

Here is a link to the dataset used in this project: [Copy of Raw Data](https://github.com/keylajb/flying-etiquette-J124-quiz4/blob/main/Copy%20of%20Flying%20etiquette%2C%20quiz%204%20J124%20-%20Raw%20Data.csv)

##Etiquette Question of Choice

Of this data, the question I chose to visualize data on was **Is it rude to wake a passenger up if you are trying to go to the bathroom?**

##Why I Chose this Question

I chose this question because it is a personal internal battle I deal with every time I fly on a plane. I worry excessively about appearing rude when having to get up to use the bathroom as someone who prefers the window seat on a flight. **I was curious to see if my opinion would be validated by this data or not.** Before visualizing this data my opinion was that it is somewhat rude to wake someone up to go use the bathroom. I personally think that it is rude to wake someone up on short, 2 hour maximum long flights because passengers should be using the bathroom before the flight to eliminate having to get up during such a short flight. It would not be rude on long flights in my opinion since the body should not be holding their need to use the bathroom for long periods of time.
